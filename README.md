# Bank Analytics

## Objectives
 The primary objective was to transform key performance indicators (KPIs) into intuitive visualizations. The aim was to create clear and comprehensible charts and graphs that addressed the specified KPIs, making it easy for everyone to understand the company's performance. This goal challenged me to refine my data analysis skills and effectively communicate insights visually, thereby facilitating better-informed decision-making based on the data.


## KPIs

 1.	Year wise loan amount Stats
 2.	Grade and sub grade wise revol_bal
 3.	Total Payment for Verified Status Vs Total Payment for Non-Verified Status
 4.	State wise and month wise loan status
 5.	Home ownership Vs last payment date stats


## Data Overview

 The dataset for this project includes personal details, professional backgrounds, and credit information of the bank's customers. It comprises two files: Finance_1 and Finance_2. Each File containing 39,000+ records and sharing a common column ID.
 
 
## Steps Followed
 
 1. Merging Datasets: Utilize Power Query in Power BI and Power Pivot in Excel to efficiently combine two CSV files based on a shared source column.

 2. Data Cleaning: The Bank Analytics dataset contains two large CSV files with 39,000+ rows, including several null and blank cells. These datasets need to be cleaned by eliminating all null and blank cells to ensure data integrity.

 3. Data Visualizations: Create dynamic dashboards using the refined KPIs by developing various visualization charts such as bar charts, column charts, pie charts and slicers.
